* add an interface to curl_url() to parse and manipulate URLs

* add urlencode/urldecode Tcl commands

* add cookie management

* currently we set CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING to "" on curl handle creation. Curl will generate
  appropriate Accept-Encoding: headers for requests and will decompress responses.
  We need to add an option to control this header and enable/disable internal decompression
  of response body in curl: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING.html

* add option "-variable". For sync request, this option will be set to
  the request handle command. For async request it will be set to the request
  handle command when request is done. It will give ability to run async requests
  without callbacks but with vwait, similar to how thread::send -async works
  "thread::send -async ... varname; vwait varname"
